# Ray Tracer Cheatsheet (Weekly Checkpoints)

This repository contains the **weekly cheatsheet + checkpoints** for the CS4212 ray tracing project.

This repo is only for **documentation, code reminders, and weekly expectations**.

## How to Use This Cheatsheet

Each week includes:

- **What you should have working by the end of the week**
- **File checklist** (what should exist in your project)

## Contributing (Students Welcome!)

If you discover something that would help other students — such as:
- a common bug + fix
- a clearer explanation of a tricky concept
- a helpful CMake reminder
- a small example scene (like a “test sphere scene”)

…you are welcome to contribute!

You can do this by opening an **Issue** (suggestion) or submitting a **Pull Request** with your improvement.
